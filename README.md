Modules to be used as a common state.

Aerial Safeguard - Go to a fall state if on the air and statetype returns S or C. Requires minimal editing on chars.

Z Axis - Move up and down if a stage's topbound or botbound parameter is not 0. If up or down is pressed after being released from 1 to 11 frames, the char will do the action it would normally do. Gets ignored if vel z isn't 0.
